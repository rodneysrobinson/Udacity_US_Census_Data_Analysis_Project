The purpose of this project is to create visualizations to reveal insights from a data set. The data visualizations should tell a story or highlight patterns in the data set. This project should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.

There are 3 different data sets you can choose from:
